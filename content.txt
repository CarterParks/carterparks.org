* About Me
* Hello, my name is Carter Parks. This site is my space for fiddling around with
web design and other topics. <br><br> This page contains information about me and
projects I am working on, as well as work that I find interesting and would like
others to know about.

* Career
* I work as a software developer. Most of my experience has been in web development,
but I have a strong interest in all areas of computing. Take a look at <a target="_blank"
href="Carter-Parks-Resume.pdf">my resume</a> and see if I would be a good fit for
the work you are doing.

* Internet Prescence
* You can email me at contact@carterparks.org <br><br> You can find my software projects
on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CarterParks">GitHub Account</a>.
<br><br> I am also on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-parks-596604242">LinkedIn</a>.

* UID
* Unfortunately, I am not the first 'Carter Parks' in the software development world. The links above are the only places
I can be found on the internet. Websites such as 'carterparks (dot) com' and accounts such as '(at) carterparks' are a
different individual entirely.

* Site Info
* The source for this site is located <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CarterParks/carterparks.org">here</a>.
The page is served by AWS S3 static hosting, although I hope to fully self-host it once
I obtain the necessary equipment. 

* OKLCH
* The <a target="_blank" href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl">
OKLCH colorspace</a> allows for hue shifting without changes in luminance or chroma.
The colors on this site all use OKLCH.

* Fonts
* This site uses Pablo Caro's <a target="_blank" href="https://pcaro.es/hermit/">Hermit
Font</a>, one of my favorite fonts, although I now use the popular <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> in my terminals, because
I like the ligatures.

* Distrohopping
* I am a OS enthusiast, and enjoy customization and control of my computer environment.
I'm currently running <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>
and using <a target="_blank" href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, a tiling, keyboard-driven
window manager.

* CLI FTW
* I have a stong preference for the command-line interface, and perform the large
marjority of my work there. I use zsh and <a target="_blank" href="https://ohmyz.sh/">omz</a>, a configuration framework with great completions, plugins, and themeing.
My terminal of choice is <a target="_blank" href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a>
a simple terminal by the suckless.org project.

* $EDITOR
* I typically use <a target="_blank" href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>, a modal
editor with a number of very useful features, such as multiple selections and excellent
shell integration.

* Self Hosted Email
* I use an installation of
<a target="_blank" href="https://maddy.email/">Maddy Email</a>
on an AWS EC2 instance to recieve email.
It was a breeze to set up and I recommend it.

* Standard Ebooks
* <a target="_blank" href="https://standardebooks.org/">The Standard Ebooks Project</a>
makes high-quality public domain ebooks. I read them on my Kobo Clara HD, which allows
sideloading of PDFs, EPUBs, etc.
