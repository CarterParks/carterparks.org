* About Me
* Hello, my name is Carter Parks. This site
is my space for fiddling around with web design and other topics. <br><br> This page
contains information about me and projects I am working on, as well as work that
I find interesting and would like others to know about.

* Career
* I work as a software developer. Most of my experience has been in web development,
but I have a strong interest in all areas of computing.
Take a look at <a target="_blank" href="Carter-Parks-Resume.pdf">my resume</a> and
see if I would be a good fit for the work you are doing.

* Internet
Prescence
* You can email me at contact@carterparks.org <br><br> You can find
my software projects on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CarterParks">GitHub
Account</a>. <br><br> I am also on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carter-parks-596604242">LinkedIn</a>.

* Site Info
* The source for this site is located <a
target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CarterParks/carterparks.org">here</a>. The
page is served by AWS S3 static hosting, although I hope to self-host it once I obtain
the necessary machinery. 

* OKLCH
* The <a target="_blank" href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl">
OKLCH colorspace</a> allows for hue shifting without changes in luminance or chroma.
The (admittedly basic) colors on the site all use OKLCH.

* Fonts
* This site uses
Pablo Caro's <a target="_blank" href="https://pcaro.es/hermit/">Hermit Font</a>,
one of my favorite fonts, although I now use the popular <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> in my terminals, because
I like the ligatures.

* Distrohopping
* I am a Linux enthusiast, and enjoy customization
and control of my computer environment. Currently I'm running the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> distribution and using <a target="_blank"
href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, a tiling, keyboard-driven window manager.

* CLI FTW
* I have a stong preference for the command-line interface, and perform
the large marjority of my work there. I typically use <a target="_blank" href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>,
a modal editor with a number of very useful features, such as multiple selections
and excellent shell integration. I also use <a target="_blank" href="https://ohmyz.sh/">
Oh My Zsh</a>, a zsh configuration framework with great completions, plugins, and themeing.

* Standard Ebooks
* <a target="_blank" href="https://standardebooks.org/">The
Standard Ebooks Project</a> makes high-quality public domain ebooks. I read them on my Kobo
Clara HD, which allows sideloading of PDFs, EPUBs, etc.

* Self Hosted Email
* Conventional wisdom says hosting your own
email is not worth the pain.
<a target="_blank" href="https://maddy.email/">Maddy Email</a>
has solved this problem for me. It was a
breeze to set up and I recommend it. My email server is running on
an AWS EC2 instance, but I'll migrate it to hardware I own once I get some.
